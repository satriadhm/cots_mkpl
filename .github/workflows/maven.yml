# This workflow will build a Java project with Maven, cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time,
# and deploy the package to GitHub Packages on release creation.
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-maven

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support documentation.
